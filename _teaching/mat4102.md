This is a short description of the lessons made in MAT4102.
The aim of this course is to give the fundamentals of machine learning, with a particular emphasis on how learning algorithms are constructed.
The course is divided into two parts: lectures where we describe the statistical models and the algorithms, and practical sessions to assess the algorithms performance with real data.
All practical sessions are done using Python notebooks

Course 1 : AI & Machine Learning Introduction
======

Course objective :
- AI and machine learning: definitions, presentation of some important concepts that have contributed to their development.
- Provide an overview of the interface between physics and mathematics
- Explain supervised and unsupervised learning
- Explain the data processing and analysis chain
- Give the “basic” methodology of data processing and analysis
- Present evaluation tools for automatic classification systems based on supervised learning

Course 2: Unsupervised learning (Clustering)
======
Course objectives:

- Introduction to clustering and evaluation of clustering quality.
- Presentation of unsupervised learning methods: partioning method (K-means, K-Medoids), hierarchical method, density-based method (DBSCAN), probabilistic method using GMM model.
- Presentation of the evaluation methodology in the context of unsupervised learning.

Course 3: Unsupervised learning (Lab session):
======
The aim of this tutorial is to study and compare different unsupervised learning algorithms covered in the course (K-Meaning, K-Medoid, DBSCAN and Gaussian Mixture Models), techniques widely used for grouping individuals, i.e.
to partition $N$ input individuals $\(X=\{X_1, . . . , X_N\}\)$ into K groups or ≪ clusters ≫. The individuals are described in a $p$-dimensional space ($X_i \in \mathbb{R}^p$).
